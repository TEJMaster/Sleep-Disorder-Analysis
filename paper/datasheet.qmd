title: "Datasheet for Decoding Sleep Disorders Through Self-Reported Patterns"
abstract: "This study uses logistic regression to analyze the relationship between self-reported sleep behaviors and the likelihood of reporting sleep troubles, using data from the NHANES 2017 to March 2020 Sleep Disorders dataset. We examine factors such as snoring frequency, daytime sleepiness, and sleep duration on weekdays and weekends. Findings indicate that excessive snoring and high daytime sleepiness are strongly associated with more reported sleep issues, while longer weekend sleep correlates with fewer reports. These results highlight the importance of good sleep hygiene for overall health and provide insights into how daily behaviors affect sleep quality."

   - The dataset was created to examine the relationships between various sleep-related factors and reported sleep troubles. It aims to analyze the influence of sleep duration, sleep habits, and sleep disorders based on data collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions.

2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
   - The dataset was compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
   - The dataset creation was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) of the United States.

4. *Any other comments?*
   - The dataset includes important adaptations to ensure continuity and representativeness despite disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Composition

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
   - Each instance represents data from an individual participant aged 16 or older, detailing their sleep patterns and associated disorders as part of the NHANES 2017-March 2020 cycle.

2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
   - The exact number of instances corresponds to the number of participants surveyed during the NHANES cycles from 2017 to March 2020. However, specific numbers can be derived from the NHANES dataset documentation.

3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
   - This dataset is a nationally representative sample combining two NHANES cycles due to the incomplete data collection caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Special weighting processes were applied to ensure representativeness.

4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
   - Each instance includes structured data about the participantâ€™s usual sleep duration on weekdays and weekends, sleep habits, and reported sleep disorders, among other health-related information.

5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
   - The primary labels include sleep duration (weekdays and weekends) and the presence of sleep disorders, used to analyze patterns and correlations in sleep behavior.

6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
   - Some instances may have missing data due to non-response or inconsistencies during data collection, which are handled according to NHANES data processing protocols.

7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
   - No explicit relationships between instances are noted; each instance is treated as independent for the purposes of public health analysis.

8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
   - No specific data splits are recommended by NHANES; researchers may determine splits based on their analytical needs.

9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
   - Errors and noise might be present due to the self-reported nature of some data and the limitations in data collection methodologies, as noted in the NHANES documentation.

10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
    - The dataset is self-contained and does not rely on external resources for its primary use. However, additional details and guidelines can be accessed through the NHANES website.
